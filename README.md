# Coding Archive
This repository is a personal archive showcasing coding projects and materials developed during high school and university. It reflects progress in competitive programming, computer science concepts, and artificial intelligence.

## Repository Structure
### Data Structures and Algorithms
Contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++.

### High School
Includes more than 300 C++ codes, most of them challenging algorithmic problems requiring advanced algorithms and data structures. Nearly 200 additional C++ solutions from past Olympiads in Informatics, solved during my preparation, are yet to be added.

This section also contains Jupyter Notebooks and personal notes for the Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, it features a few C# projects, such as a client-server app and a simple email system.

### University
Comprises assignments and projects from university, organized by semester. Currently includes about 50 C/C++ algorithmic problems and a few simple Bash programs.
